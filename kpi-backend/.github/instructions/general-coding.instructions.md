# General Coding Standards

## Philosophy
- Clean Code (SOLID, KISS, DRY)
- Testable and maintainable code
- Security by design

## Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for classes, interfaces, decorators
- camelCase for functions, variables
- No underscore prefix for private members (use `private`)
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `user.service.ts`)
- Suffix DTOs with `Dto` (e.g., `CreateUserDto`)
- Suffix controllers with `Controller` (e.g., `UserController`)
